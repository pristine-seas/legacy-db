    "text": "FAIR Data Commitment\nThe Pristine Seas Science Database is designed to uphold the FAIR data principles — ensuring that all data are Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable for the long term. This includes:\n\nFindable: Unique identifiers (ps_site_id, taxon_id) and rich metadata ensure all records can be discovered and indexed\nAccessible: Hosted in BigQuery with open protocols and companion tools for direct querying, downloading, and exploration\nInteroperable: Uses tidy formats, SI units, ISO 8601 dates, and controlled vocabularies across all tables\nReusable: Fully documented with versioning, contributor metadata, QA flags, and modular design to support transparent reuse and scientific replication\n\nTogether, these practices ensure the database serves as a durable, transparent, and reusable resource for science and conservation.",

    "text": "2 Data Model\nAll sampling data in the Pristine Seas Database are structured around a shared spatial hierarchy. This enables consistent grouping and comparison of observations across expeditions, methods, and regions.\nThe hierarchy consists of six nested levels:\n\nExpedition\nA discrete field campaign or cruise\ne.g., COL_2024\n\nRegion\nBroad administrative, ecological, or biogeographic unit.\ne.g., Murat, Chocó, Temotu\n\nSubregion\nMid-scale feature within the region such as a single island, atoll, gulf, or reef complex\ne.g., Mussau, Golfo de Tribugá, Utupua\n\nLocality Local named feature such as a reef, bay, cove, or village\ne.g., Navigator bank, Lolieng, Tasitel\n\nSite\nA specific location withint the subregion where a survey method (e.g., UVS, BRUVS, eDNA) was used. e.g., COL_2024_uvs_001\n\nStation\nA discrete sampling unit within a site, corresponding to a specific depth, or replicate. e.g., COL_2024_uvs_001_10m\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNaming Conventions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNaming Conventions\n\n\n\nTo ensure consistency, traceability, and joinability across all datasets, Pristine Seas uses machine-readable, structured identifiers for sites and stations.\n\nexp_id: ISO3_YEAR\n  → Example: FJI_2025\nps_site_id: exp_id_method_###\n  → Always use 3-digit padding for site numbers (e.g., 001, 045, 112)\n  → Examples:\n    FJI_2025_uvs_001\n    FJI_2025_pbruv_003\n    FJI_2025_sub_014\nps_station_id: ps_site_id_depth or ps_site_id_replicate\n  → Depth and replicate suffixes use fixed formats (e.g., 10m, r101)\n  → Examples:\n    FJI_2025_uvs_001_10m – Underwater visual survey at 10m depth\n    FJI_2025_pbruv_003_r102 – rig 102 of pelagic BRUV deployment 3\n    FJI_2025_dscm_006_300m – deep sea camera at 300m\n\nThese identifiers are used throughout the database as primary keys in spatial/, and foreign keys in all method datasets.",
