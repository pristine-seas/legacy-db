    "text": "Fish BLT Surveys\nThe fish belt transect (BLT) protocol is the primary method used to quantify reef fish assemblages at UVS sites. Divers swim standardized belt transects, visually identifying and sizing all fishes observed within a defined area. This method yields robust estimates of fish abundance, biomass, and community structure across depth strata and regions (see SOP for full methods).\nFish BLT data are stored into three tables:\n\nuvs.blt_stations — Metadata for each station, including depth, diver, effort, and summary metrics\nuvs.blt_observations — Raw fish counts by species, size class, and transect\nuvs.blt_biomass_by_taxa — Derived biomass by station and taxon, using length-weight relationships\n\nAll records are linked via ps_station_id, and species names are standardized using taxon_id from taxonomy.fish.\n\nuvs.blt_stations\nThis table contains one row per depth-stratified fish survey conducted at a UVS site. Each row includes dive metadata, survey effort (e.g., number of transects, area surveyed), and ecological summaries such as richness, total abundance, and biomass. Stations are linked to uvs.sites via ps_site_id. The ps_station_id is generated by appending a standardized depth bin label to the ps_site_id.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStandard depth strata for UVS methods\n\n\n\nTo ensure consistency across sites and protocols, station depth (depth_m) is binned into standard strata using fixed thresholds. The binned depth label is then appended to the ps_site_id to generate a unique ps_station_id.\nDepth strata and labels:\n\nSupershallow: &lt;= 6 m → 05m\n\nShallow: 7–14 m → 10m\n\nDeep: &gt;= 15 m → 20m\n\nExamples:\n\nIf a fish transect is conducted at 5.8 m → station ID = FJI_2025_uvs_001_05m\n\nIf the same site has another transect at 14.7 m → FJI_2025_uvs_001_10m\n\nThis depth binning scheme ensures consistent stratification across analyses, regardless of slight depth variation between dives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Fields in the uvs.blt_stations table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField\nType\nRequired\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nps_station_id\nSTRING\ntrue\nUnique station ID (ps_site_id_depth), e.g., CHL_2024_uvs_001_20m\n\n\nps_site_id\nSTRING\ntrue\n◂ Foreign key to UVS site table\n\n\nexp_id\nSTRING\ntrue\n◂ Expedition ID (ISO3_YEAR)\n\n\nmethod\nSTRING\ntrue\n◂ Survey method (uvs)\n\n\nprotocol\nSTRING\ntrue\nSurvey protocol (fish_blt) used at the station\n\n\ndivers\nSTRING\ntrue\nNames of divers who conducted the transects (comma-separated)\n\n\ndate\nDATE\ntrue\n◂ Survey date (YYYY-MM-DD)\n\n\ntime\nTIME\ntrue\n◂ Survey start time (24-hour format)\n\n\ndepth_m\nFLOAT\ntrue\nAverage depth of the station (m)\n\n\ndepth_strata\nSTRING\ntrue\nBinned depth category: supershallow, shallow, or deep\n\n\nregion\nSTRING\ntrue\n◂ Region name\n\n\nsubregion\nSTRING\ntrue\n◂ Subregion name\n\n\nlocality\nSTRING\nfalse\n◂ Optional local feature (e.g., reef, bay, cove)\n\n\nn_transects\nINTEGER\ntrue\nNumber of fish transects completed at the station\n\n\ntransect_length\nFLOAT\ntrue\nLength of each transect (m)\n\n\ntransect_width\nFLOAT\ntrue\nWidth of each transect (m)\n\n\nsurvey_area_m2\nFLOAT\ntrue\nTotal area surveyed at the station (m²)\n\n\nhabitat\nSTRING\ntrue\n◂ Habitat type (see controlled vocabulary)\n\n\nexposure\nSTRING\ntrue\n◂ Exposure type (see controlled vocabulary)\n\n\nn_species\nINTEGER\nfalse\nSpecies richness (optional summary)\n\n\nabundance_m2\nFLOAT\nfalse\nFish abundance (individuals/m², optional summary)\n\n\nbiomass_gm2\nFLOAT\nfalse\nFish biomass (grams/m², optional summary)\n\n\nnotes\nSTRING\nfalse\nOptional comments or QA notes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nuvs.blt_observations\nThis table contains one row per fish observation recorded on an individual transect during a belt transect survey.

    "text": "The submersible survey dataset includes data collected during dives using manned submersibles to explore mesophotic and deep reef habitats. Each dive is treated as a site, and each transect or visual segment within that dive is recorded as a station. This structure enables integration with the broader Pristine Seas schema while preserving method-specific granularity.\nSubmersibles allow access to depths beyond safe diving limits, providing high-resolution video and visual observations in habitats that are otherwise difficult to survey. These data are particularly important for understanding community structure and species distributions in mesophotic zones, deep slopes, and hard-to-access reef environments.\nThe dataset consists of two interlinked tables:\n\nsub.sites — Deployment-level metadata, including operational context and submersible details\nsub.stations — Segment-level records capturing each horizontal transect or visual survey segment\n\nEach record is linked by ps_site_id, and species observations (when available) are stored separately in protocol-specific data tables.\n\n\nTables\n\n\n\nSites (sub.sites)\nEach row represents a submersible deployment (i.e., one complete dive). This table includes spatial coordinates, dive timing, and method-specific metadata such as the submersible name, dive type (e.g., science, media), maximum depth reached, pilot name, and primary scientific observer. • The start of descent provides the standard time, latitude, and longitude values for integration with the expedition-wide schema. • The primary observer is recorded in the lead field, consistent with other methods. • Additional fields track operational highlights and submersible metadata.\n\n\nStations (sub.stations)\nEach row corresponds to a visual survey segment or transect conducted during a submersible dive. These records capture the spatial and environmental context of each observation unit, including start and end times, depth range, habitat descriptors, and optional video annotations.\nStations allow for detailed stratification of observations within a dive and support both quantitative and qualitative analyses of submersible data. Each record is linked to its parent site via ps_site_id.\n\n\nObservations (sub.observations)\nThis table is reserved for future integration of species-level observations or annotations linked to submersible transects.

This method follows the Pristine Seas convention for passive, unreplicated deployments in which no separate sites table is used.\nDeep-sea camera data are stored in two interlinked tables:\n\ndscm.stations — One row per camera deployment, including spatial, environmental, and technical metadata\ndscm.maxn_by_taxa — Summary table of fish observations per station, including MaxN and species traits\n\nSpecies identities are standardized using accepted_aphia_id, ensuring consistency with taxonomy.fish and supporting integration with other fish survey methods.\n\n\nTables\n\n\n\nStations (dscm.stations)\nThis table contains one row per deep-sea camera deployment. Each record includes the spatial coordinates, deployment time, environmental descriptors, and technical specifications of the camera unit. Because DSCM deployments are unreplicated and spatially discrete, no separate sites table is used — the station is the primary unit of observation and analysis.\nKey fields include deployment and recovery times and positions, bottom depth and temperature, camera settings, and a general habitat description. These metadata support standardization across deployments and enable linkage to derived metrics such as MaxN.\n\n\nMaxN (dscm.maxN)\nThis table stores per-station summaries of fish observations recorded from deep-sea camera footage. Each row corresponds to a unique combination of ps_station_id and taxon, reporting MaxN (the maximum number of individuals observed simultaneously) as a conservative estimate of relative abundance.\nTaxonomic identity is standardized via accepted_aphia_id, with supporting fields such as family and trophic_group joined from the centralized fish taxonomy table.

    "text": "Overview\nThe Line Point Intercept (LPI) protocol is used to quantify benthic community composition at Pristine Seas UVS sites. Divers swim along a fixed transect line and record the benthic taxon or category directly beneath a series of regularly spaced sampling points.\nPoints are recorded every 20 cm along a 50-meter transect, yielding 250 point intercepts per station, typically divided into five 10-meter sections (50 points each). In some cases, shorter transects (e.g., 30 m) are used, resulting in fewer total points.\nThis method yields high-resolution estimates of percent cover for key benthic groups—such as hard coral, macroalgae, crustose coralline algae (CCA), and cyanobacteria—and supports assessments of reef condition and spatial variability.\nLPI data are organized across three interlinked tables:\n\nuvs.lpi_stations - Metadata and summary metrics for each LPI transect station\nuvs.lpi_counts - Point intercept counts per morphotaxon, station, and section\nuvs.lpi_cover_by_taxa - Percent cover summaries by taxon or functional group, per station\n\nAll records are linked via ps_station_id.

    "text": "Overview\nThe Seabed Baited Remote Underwater Video (SBRUV) protocol is used to survey fish communities across a wide range of reef-associated and coastal habitats. It is especially effective for detecting large, cryptic, or disturbance-sensitive species — including reef sharks and carnivores — that may be underrepresented in diver-based methods.\nEach SBRUV station consists of a stereo-video rig deployed on the seafloor for a fixed soak time (typically 60 minutes). Only the first hour of footage is analyzed. Bait is used to attract fishes into view, and species are identified using standardized video protocols.\nSBRUV data are organized into two interlinked tables:\n\nsbruv.stations — Deployment metadata, including spatial context, rig setup, bait, and video info\nsbruv.maxn_by_taxa — Species-level summaries per station, based on MaxN and linked traits\n\nSpecies are standardized using accepted_aphia_id, enabling integration with taxonomy.fish.\n\n\n\nTables\n\n\nStations (sbruv.stations)\nThis table contains one row per Seabed BRUVS (SBRUV) deployment.
