    "text": "Fish BLT Surveys\nThe fish belt transect (BLT) protocol is the primary method used to quantify reef fish assemblages at UVS sites. Divers swim standardized belt transects, visually identifying and sizing all fishes observed within a defined area. This method yields robust estimates of fish abundance, biomass, and community structure across depth strata and regions (see SOP for full methods).\nFish BLT data are stored into three tables:\n\nuvs.blt_stations — Metadata for each station, including depth, diver, effort, and summary metrics\nuvs.blt_observations — Raw fish counts by species, size class, and transect\nuvs.blt_biomass_by_taxa — Derived biomass by station and taxon, using length-weight relationships\n\nAll records are linked via ps_station_id, and species names are standardized using taxon_id from taxonomy.fish.\n\nuvs.blt_stations\nThis table contains one row per depth-stratified fish survey conducted at a UVS site. Each row includes dive metadata, survey effort (e.g., number of transects, area surveyed), and ecological summaries such as richness, total abundance, and biomass. Stations are linked to uvs.sites via ps_site_id. The ps_station_id is generated by appending a standardized depth bin label to the ps_site_id.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStandard depth strata for UVS methods\n\n\n\nTo ensure consistency across sites and protocols, station depth (depth_m) is binned into standard strata using fixed thresholds. The binned depth label is then appended to the ps_site_id to generate a unique ps_station_id.\nDepth strata and labels:\n\nSupershallow: &lt;= 6 m → 05m\n\nShallow: 7–14 m → 10m\n\nDeep: &gt;= 15 m → 20m\n\nExamples:\n\nIf a fish transect is conducted at 5.8 m → station ID = FJI_2025_uvs_001_05m\n\nIf the same site has another transect at 14.7 m → FJI_2025_uvs_001_10m\n\nThis depth binning scheme ensures consistent stratification across analyses, regardless of slight depth variation between dives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Fields in the uvs.blt_stations table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField\nType\nRequired\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nps_station_id\nSTRING\ntrue\nUnique station ID (ps_site_id_depth), e.g., CHL_2024_uvs_001_20m\n\n\nps_site_id\nSTRING\ntrue\n◂ Foreign key to UVS site table\n\n\nexp_id\nSTRING\ntrue\n◂ Expedition ID (ISO3_YEAR)\n\n\nmethod\nSTRING\ntrue\n◂ Survey method (uvs)\n\n\nprotocol\nSTRING\ntrue\nSurvey protocol (fish_blt) used at the station\n\n\ndivers\nSTRING\ntrue\nNames of divers who conducted the transects (comma-separated)\n\n\ndate\nDATE\ntrue\n◂ Survey date (YYYY-MM-DD)\n\n\ntime\nTIME\ntrue\n◂ Survey start time (24-hour format)\n\n\ndepth_m\nFLOAT\ntrue\nAverage depth of the station (m)\n\n\ndepth_strata\nSTRING\ntrue\nBinned depth category: supershallow, shallow, or deep\n\n\nregion\nSTRING\ntrue\n◂ Region name\n\n\nsubregion\nSTRING\ntrue\n◂ Subregion name\n\n\nlocality\nSTRING\nfalse\n◂ Optional local feature (e.g., reef, bay, cove)\n\n\nn_transects\nINTEGER\ntrue\nNumber of fish transects completed at the station\n\n\ntransect_length\nFLOAT\ntrue\nLength of each transect (m)\n\n\ntransect_width\nFLOAT\ntrue\nWidth of each transect (m)\n\n\nsurvey_area_m2\nFLOAT\ntrue\nTotal area surveyed at the station (m²)\n\n\nhabitat\nSTRING\ntrue\n◂ Habitat type (see controlled vocabulary)\n\n\nexposure\nSTRING\ntrue\n◂ Exposure type (see controlled vocabulary)\n\n\nn_species\nINTEGER\nfalse\nSpecies richness (optional summary)\n\n\nabundance_m2\nFLOAT\nfalse\nFish abundance (individuals/m², optional summary)\n\n\nbiomass_gm2\nFLOAT\nfalse\nFish biomass (grams/m², optional summary)\n\n\nnotes\nSTRING\nfalse\nOptional comments or QA notes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nuvs.blt_observations\nThis table contains one row per fish observation recorded on an individual transect during a belt transect survey.

    "text": "Fish BLT Surveys\nThe fish belt transect (BLT) protocol is the primary method used to quantify reef fish assemblages at UVS sites. Divers swim standardized belt transects, visually identifying and sizing all fishes observed within a defined area. This method yields robust estimates of fish abundance, biomass, and community structure across depth strata and regions (see SOP for full methods).\nFish BLT data are stored into three tables:\n\nuvs.blt_stations — Metadata for each station, including depth, diver, effort, and summary metrics\nuvs.blt_observations — Raw fish counts by species, size class, and transect\nuvs.blt_biomass_by_taxa — Derived biomass by station and taxon, using length-weight relationships\n\nAll records are linked via ps_station_id, and species names are standardized using taxon_id from taxonomy.fish.\n\nuvs.blt_stations\nThis table contains one row per depth-stratified fish survey conducted at a UVS site. Each row includes dive metadata, survey effort (e.g., number of transects, area surveyed), and ecological summaries such as richness, total abundance, and biomass. Stations are linked to uvs.sites via ps_site_id. The ps_station_id is generated by appending a standardized depth bin label to the ps_site_id.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStandard depth strata for UVS methods\n\n\n\nTo ensure consistency across sites and protocols, station depth (depth_m) is binned into standard strata using fixed thresholds. The binned depth label is then appended to the ps_site_id to generate a unique ps_station_id.\nDepth strata and labels:\n\nSupershallow: &lt;= 6 m → 05m\n\nShallow: 7–14 m → 10m\n\nDeep: &gt;= 15 m → 20m\n\nExamples:\n\nIf a fish transect is conducted at 5.8 m → station ID = FJI_2025_uvs_001_05m\n\nIf the same site has another transect at 14.7 m → FJI_2025_uvs_001_10m\n\nThis depth binning scheme ensures consistent stratification across analyses, regardless of slight depth variation between dives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Fields in the uvs.blt_stations table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField\nType\nRequired\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nps_station_id\nSTRING\ntrue\nUnique station ID (ps_site_id_depth), e.g., CHL_2024_uvs_001_20m\n\n\nps_site_id\nSTRING\ntrue\n◂ Foreign key to UVS site table\n\n\nexp_id\nSTRING\ntrue\n◂ Expedition ID (ISO3_YEAR)\n\n\nmethod\nSTRING\ntrue\n◂ Survey method (uvs)\n\n\nprotocol\nSTRING\ntrue\nSurvey protocol (fish_blt) used at the station\n\n\ndivers\nSTRING\ntrue\nNames of divers who conducted the transects (comma-separated)\n\n\ndate\nDATE\ntrue\n◂ Survey date (YYYY-MM-DD)\n\n\ntime\nTIME\ntrue\n◂ Survey start time (24-hour format)\n\n\ndepth_m\nFLOAT\ntrue\nAverage depth of the station (m)\n\n\ndepth_strata\nSTRING\ntrue\nBinned depth category: supershallow, shallow, or deep\n\n\nregion\nSTRING\ntrue\n◂ Region name\n\n\nsubregion\nSTRING\ntrue\n◂ Subregion name\n\n\nlocality\nSTRING\nfalse\n◂ Optional local feature (e.g., reef, bay, cove)\n\n\nn_transects\nINTEGER\ntrue\nNumber of fish transects completed at the station\n\n\ntransect_length\nFLOAT\ntrue\nLength of each transect (m)\n\n\ntransect_width\nFLOAT\ntrue\nWidth of each transect (m)\n\n\nsurvey_area_m2\nFLOAT\ntrue\nTotal area surveyed at the station (m²)\n\n\nhabitat\nSTRING\ntrue\n◂ Habitat type (see controlled vocabulary)\n\n\nexposure\nSTRING\ntrue\n◂ Exposure type (see controlled vocabulary)\n\n\nn_species\nINTEGER\nfalse\nSpecies richness (optional summary)\n\n\nabundance_m2\nFLOAT\nfalse\nFish abundance (individuals/m², optional summary)\n\n\nbiomass_gm2\nFLOAT\nfalse\nFish biomass (grams/m², optional summary)\n\n\nnotes\nSTRING\nfalse\nOptional comments or QA notes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nuvs.blt_observations\nThis table contains one row per fish observation recorded on an individual transect during a belt transect survey.
