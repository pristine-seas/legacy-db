This structure enables consistent grouping, filtering, and comparison of observations across expeditions, regions, habitats, and depth strata.\nThe hierarchy has six nested levels:\n\nExpedition\nA defined research campaign or cruise\ne.g., COL_2024\n\nRegion\nBroad geographic or administrative areas\ne.g., Murat, Chocó, Tuamotu\n\nSubregion\nIntermediate units such as islands, atolls, gulfs, or reef complexes\ne.g., Mussau, Golfo de Tribugá\n\nLocality (optional)\nLocal named features such as towns, communities, bays, coves, reefs\ne.g., Lolieng, Ensenada Utría\n\nSite\nA single deployment of a given method at a location\ne.g., an underwater visual survey dive or BRUVS set\n\nStation\nThe specific sampling unit within a site\ne.g., a transect, rig, depth bin, or replicate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNaming Conventions\n\n\n\nPristine Seas uses structured, machine-readable identifiers to ensure consistency, traceability, and correct sorting across all datasets.\n\nexp_id: ISO3_YEAR\n  → Example: FJI_2025\nps_site_id: exp_id_method_###\n  → Always use 3-digit padding for site numbers (e.g., 001, 045, 112)\n  → Examples:\n    FJI_2025_uvs_001\n    FJI_2025_pbruv_003\n    FJI_2025_sub_014\nps_station_id: ps_site_id_depth or ps_site_id_replicate\n  → Depth and replicate suffixes use fixed formats (e.g., 10m, r101)\n  → Examples:\n    FJI_2025_uvs_001_10m – Underwater visual survey at 10m depth\n    FJI_2025_pbruv_003_r102 – rig 102 of pelagic BRUV deployment 3\n    FJI_2025_dscm_006_300m – deep sea camera at 300m"

    "text": "Architecture\nThe Pristine Seas Science Database is organized into modular datasets, structured primarily by survey method. Each method has its own BigQuery dataset (e.g., uvs, pbruv, sub, edna), containing standardized tables for sites, stations, observations, and optional summaries.\nThree shared datasets provide integration across all methods:\n\nspatial/ — Canonical registry of expeditions, sites, and stations, including regional hierarchy\ntaxonomy/ — Unified reference list of taxa and trait metadata\nlookup/ — Controlled vocabularies, QA flags, and contributor information\n\nThis architecture supports method-specific pipelines while enabling consistent spatial joins, trait-based analysis, and cross-method integration.\n\nDataset Layout\nAll method datasets follow a consistent internal structure to support tidy workflows and scalable processing:\n\nsites — One row per method-specific deployment (e.g., dive, BRUV drop, eDNA station)\nstations — Sampling units within each site (e.g., depth strata, rig, transect)\nobservations — Raw biological or environmental records (e.g., species counts, point hits, sequence detections)\nsummaries (optional) — Aggregated metrics at the station level (e.g., biomass, MaxN, % cover)\n\n\n\nCross-Method Linkage\nAll datasets are designed to join cleanly via shared spatial and taxonomic identifiers:\n\nps_site_id and ps_station_id uniquely identify spatial sampling units across modules\ntaxon_id links observations to a centralized taxonomy and trait system\nControlled vocabularies in lookup/ ensure consistency in fields like habitat, exposure, and gear type\n\nThis shared structure enables integrated analyses across methods, regions, and taxa while preserving the distinct protocols and metadata of each method."
