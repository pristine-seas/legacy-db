#### Overview

The fish belt transect (BLT) protocol is the primary method used to quantify reef fish assemblages at UVS sites. Divers swim standardized belt transects, visually identifying and sizing all fishes observed within a defined area. This method yields robust estimates of fish abundance, biomass, and community structure across depth strata and regions (see SOP for full methods).

Fish BLT data are organized across three interlinked tables:

- `uvs.blt_stations` - Metadata for each station, including depth, diver, transect area, and summary metrics
- `uvs.blt_observations` - Raw fish counts by species, size class, and transect replicate
- `uvs.blt_biomass_by_taxa` - Derived biomass by station and taxon, calculated using standard length–weight relationships

All records are linked by `ps_station_id`, and species are standardized via `accepted_aphia_id` (foreign key to `taxonomy.fish`).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Tables 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### Stations (`uvs.blt_stations`)

This table contains one record per depth-stratified fish survey conducted at a UVS site. Each row includes core spatial and survey metadata — such as depth, date, divers, and number of transects — along with ecological summaries (e.g., species richness, fish abundance, biomass).

Stations are linked to `uvs.sites` via `ps_site_id`, and uniquely identified using a depth-binned `ps_station_id`. This table provides the context and summary metrics for interpreting observation-level data.


::: {.callout-note title="Standard UVS depth strata"}

To ensure consistency across regions and survey protocols, all UVS stations are binned into standardized depth strata based on fixed thresholds. These depth bins are appended to the `ps_site_id` to generate the full `ps_station_id`.

**Depth strata and suffixes:**

- **Supershallow (`<= 6 m`)** → `05m`  
- **Shallow (`7–14 m`)** → `10m`  
- **Deep (`>= 15 m`)**  → `20m`

**Examples:**

- A survey at 5.8 m → `FJI_2025_uvs_001_05m`
- A survey at 14.7 m → `FJI_2025_uvs_001_10m`

This scheme ensures consistent stratification across all analyses, even with natural variation in survey depth.

##### Observations (`uvs.blt_observations`)

This table stores raw fish observations recorded during individual belt transects. Each row captures a unique combination of species, estimated total length (cm), and count, representing a single diver observation within a defined transect area.

In addition to raw counts, it includes derived metrics such as biomass (`biomass_g`) and biomass density (`biomass_gm2`), calculated using species-specific length–weight parameters from `taxonomy.fish`. Observations are linked to their parent station via `ps_station_id`, and taxonomic identity is standardized using `accepted_aphia_id`.

::: {.callout-note title="Standard transect dimensions"}
- Fish **≥ 20 cm** are recorded along a 25 m × 4 m belt (100 m²)
- Fish **< 20 cm** are recorded along a 25 m × 2 m belt (50 m²)

##### Biomass by taxa (`uvs.blt_biomass_by_taxa`)

This table contains station-level summaries of reef fish abundance and biomass by species, derived from raw BLT transect observations. It serves as the primary analysis-ready table for assessing community structure, trophic composition, and biomass patterns.

Each row represents a unique combination of `ps_station_id` and species. Metrics are expressed as **mean values across all transects** at the station, with **zeros imputed for transects where the species was not observed**. This approach ensures unbiased station-level estimates of:

- count_m2 - average density (individuals/m²)
- biomass_gm2 - average biomass (g/m²)

Species identity is standardized via `accepted_aphia_id`, with taxonomic and ecological traits (e.g., family, trophic group) joined from `taxonomy.fish`. These fields support flexible aggregation by trophic or functional guild.
