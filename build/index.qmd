The **Pristine Seas Science Database** is a centralized, modular system for ecological data collected across more than a decade of scientific expeditions led by **National Geographic Pristine Seas**. It is designed to support high-integrity, reproducible research on marine biodiversity and inform global ocean conservation policy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Why This Matters

Conservation begins with knowledge. The Pristine Seas Science Database is a globally unique resource that helps answer foundational questions about ocean health, biodiversity, and ecosystem change.

Spanning all major ocean basins and more than 40 expeditions, it brings together standardized data from Arctic fjords to tropical reefs — across ecosystems as varied as coastal bays, deep-sea trenches, and open-ocean pelagic zones. Its strength lies in its **breadth** and **integration**: from seabird surveys to submersible dives, eDNA to benthic cover — all unified by a shared spatial and taxonomic scaffold.

This system enables:

- Fast, reproducible analysis across sites, regions, and years  
- Cross-method synthesis grounded in a modular yet consistent structure  
- Scalable science that informs conservation, policy, and decision-making  

Whether you’re a scientist, analyst, or conservation partner, this documentation will guide you through the structure, conventions, and workflows that make the Pristine Seas Science Database a powerful tool for understanding and protecting our oceans.

## Key Features

The database is designed for flexibility, scientific rigor, and long-term usability. Its core features include:

- **Modular by Method**  
  Supports diverse survey protocols — from reef fish and benthic cover to eDNA, BRUVS, submersibles, and seabird transects — each with a standardized schema.

- **Spatially Anchored**  
  Built on a hierarchical spatial model: expedition → region → subregion → site → station. This structure enables robust spatial integration and filtering.

- **Taxonomically Standardized**  
  Centralized taxonomy with harmonized species names, traits, and functional groups across all methods.

- **Analysis-Ready**  
  Tidy-format tables, clear join keys, and native organization in Google BigQuery make the system efficient for large-scale ecological analyses.

- **Collaborator-Friendly**  
  Transparent, well-documented, and modular — designed for reuse, extension, and shared scientific workflows.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAIR Data Commitment

The database adheres to the FAIR data principles — ensuring that all records are:

- **Findable**  
  With unique identifiers (e.g., `ps_site_id`, `aphia_id`) and rich metadata for discovery and indexing.

- **Accessible**  
  Hosted in Google BigQuery, with open protocols and companion tools for direct querying and download.

- **Interoperable**  
  Built using tidy data principles, standardized units (SI), ISO 8601 dates, and controlled vocabularies.

- **Reusable**  
  Fully documented with versioning, contributor metadata, QA flags, and modular design — supporting transparency, scientific replication, and long-term utility.
