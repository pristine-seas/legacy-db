The **Pristine Seas Science Database** is a centralized, modular system that stores ecological data collected from more than a decade of scientific expeditions led by **National Geographic Pristine Seas**. It is designed to support high-integrity, reproducible research on marine biodiversity and inform conservation policy around the world.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Why This Matters

Conservation starts with knowledge. This database helps answer fundamental questions about ocean health, marine biodiversity, and ecosystem change by:

- Unifying biological, habitat, and environmental data from multiple methods
- Anchoring all records to a shared spatial and taxonomic backbone
- Enabling fast, reproducible analysis across sites, regions, and years

Whether you're a scientist or conservation partner, this documentation will guide you through the database’s architecture, conventions, and workflows.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Key Features

- **Modular by method**: Supports fish surveys, benthic assessments, eDNA, BRUVs, submersible surveys, and more
- **Spatially anchored**: Built around a nested expedition → region → site → station structure
- **Taxonomically standardized**: Harmonized names, traits, and groupings across datasets
- **Analysis-ready**: Long-format tables, clear join keys, and BigQuery-native organization
- **Collaborator-friendly**: Designed for transparency, reproducibility, and shared work

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAIR Data Commitment

The Pristine Seas Science Database is designed to uphold the FAIR data principles — ensuring that all data are Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable for the long term. This includes:

- **Findable**: Unique identifiers (ps_site_id, taxon_id) and rich metadata ensure all records can be discovered and indexed
- **Accessible**: Hosted in BigQuery with open protocols and companion tools for direct querying, downloading, and exploration
- **Interoperable**: Uses tidy formats, SI units, ISO 8601 dates, and controlled vocabularies across all tables
- **Reusable**:  Fully documented with versioning, contributor metadata, QA flags, and modular design to support transparent reuse and scientific replication

Together, these practices ensure the database serves as a durable, transparent, and reusable resource for science and conservation.
