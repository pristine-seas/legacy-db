The Pristine Seas Science Database is organized around modular **method datasets**, each corresponding to a specific field protocol used during scientific expeditions. These include underwater visual surveys (UVS), BRUVS, eDNA sampling, submersible dives, and more. Each method has its own schema tailored to the sampling design, data structure, and analytical needs of that technique.

All method datasets follow a common pattern of internal tables â€” typically including:

- `sites`: deployments of the method at a given location and time  
- `stations`: finer-scale spatial or depth-stratified sampling units  
- `observations`: raw or cleaned data records (e.g., species counts, detections)  
- `summaries`: optional station-level aggregates (e.g., biomass, percent cover)

Despite methodological differences, each dataset is aligned with shared **spatial**, **taxonomic**, and **vocabulary** references. This allows for standardized integration, analysis, and reporting across methods and expeditions.

#### Structure and Purpose

Each method dataset:

- Captures **raw field data and derived metrics** in a tidy, analysis-ready format  
- Respects the **structure and nuances** of the field protocol  
- Joins seamlessly to the core spatial (`expeditions.sites`), taxonomic (`taxonomy.fish`, etc.), and controlled vocabulary (`lookup/`) tables  
- Enables **cross-method integration** through common keys and shared architecture

#### Currently Documented Methods

This section of the documentation focuses on the following datasets:

- **Underwater Visual Surveys (UVS)**: SCUBA-based protocols for reef fish, benthic cover, invertebrates, and coral recruits
- *(More to come)*: pBRUVS, sBRUVS, eDNA, submersibles, and others

Each method is documented in its own subsection, with table-level details, controlled vocabularies, and usage notes.
