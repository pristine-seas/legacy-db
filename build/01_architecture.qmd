The **Pristine Seas Science Database** is a modular, analysis-ready system for organizing ecological data collected across more than 40 expeditions worldwide. Its design balances flexibility — to accommodate diverse survey methods — and consistency — to support clean integration, querying, and long-term analysis.

At its core, the system is organized around two major dataset groups:

- **Method Datasets**: One for each survey technique (e.g., UVS, BRUVS, eDNA), with standardized tables for sites, stations, observations, and summaries
- **Reference Datasets**: Shared taxonomic, spatial, and lookup tables that provide a unified backbone across all methods

---

## Core Structure

All data are hosted in **Google BigQuery** under the project `pristine-seas`, organized into top-level datasets grouped by function.


### Method Datasets

Each method has its own dataset (e.g., `uvs`, `pbruv`, `sub`, `edna`) that stores raw and summarized outputs from a given type of field survey. These follow a common structure, with tables for:

- `sites` — Survey events or deployments (e.g., dive, deployment, survey)
- `stations` — Sampling units within a site (e.g., depth strata, rigs)
- `observations` — Primary ecological or environmental records
- `summaries` — Aggregated station-level metrics

### Reference Datasets

These datasets provide a shared scaffold for spatial joins, species trait integration, QA/QC, and consistent metadata across all methods:

- **`expeditions/`** — Registry of expeditions, sites, stations, and regional hierarchy
- **`taxonomy/`** — Harmonized species lists and trait metadata
- **`lookup/`** — Controlled vocabularies, flags, and contributor metadata

## Data Model

All data in the Pristine Seas Science Database are structured around a shared, hierarchical spatial model. This enables standardized grouping, filtering, and integration across methods, expeditions, and geographies.

- **Expedition**  
  A defined field campaign
  _e.g., `COL_2024`_

  - **Region**  
    Broad geographic or administrative area   
    _e.g., Murat, Chocó, Temotu_

    - **Subregion**  
      Intermediate unit like an island such as a single island, atoll, gulf, or reef complex  
      _e.g.,  Navigator bank, Mussau, Golfo de Tribugá, Utupua_

      - **Locality**
        Local named feature such as a community, village, islet.  
        _e.g.,  Lolieng, Tasitel_

        - **Site**  
          A specific location within the subregion where a survey method (e.g., UVS, BRUVS, eDNA) was used.
          _e.g., `COL_2024_uvs_001`_

          - **Station**  
            A discrete sampling unit within a site, corresponding to a specific depth, or replicate.
            _e.g., `COL_2024_uvs_001_10m`_

##### Naming Conventions

::: {.callout-tip title="Naming Conventions"}

To ensure consistency, traceability, and joinability across all datasets, Pristine Seas uses machine-readable, structured identifiers for sites and stations.

- **`exp_id`**: `ISO3_YEAR`  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;→ Example: `FJI_2025`

- **`ps_site_id`**: `exp_id_method_###`  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;→ Always use **3-digit padding** for site numbers (e.g., `001`, `045`, `112`)  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;→ Examples:  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`FJI_2025_uvs_001`  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`FJI_2025_pbruv_003`  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`FJI_2025_sub_014`

- **`ps_station_id`**: `ps_site_id_depth` or `ps_site_id_replicate`  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;→ Depth and replicate suffixes use fixed formats (e.g., `10m`, `r101`)  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;→ Examples:  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`FJI_2025_uvs_001_10m` – Underwater visual survey at 10m depth  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`FJI_2025_pbruv_003_r102` – rig 102 of pelagic BRUV deployment 3  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`FJI_2025_dscm_006_300m` – deep sea camera at 300m

These identifiers are used throughout the database as primary keys in `spatial/`, and foreign keys in all method datasets.

## Style & Conventions

::: {.callout-note title="Database Style Guide"}

**Naming**

- Table and field names use **`snake_case`**
- All names are lowercase, except for proper nouns like scientific names or geographic locations. 
- **No spaces or special characters** 
- Names are concise, descriptive, and consistently formatted

**Units and Standards**

- **Metric system (SI)** for  all measurements ( _e.g., `depth_m`, `biomass_gm2`, `temperature_c`_ )
- Dates (**ISO 8601**): `YYYY-MM-DD`  
- Times (**24-hour format**): `HH:MM:SS`

**Structure**

- Tables follow a **long format** — one row per observation or measurement
- `ps_site_id` and `ps_station_id` are universal spatial keys
- Controlled vocabularies (e.g., habitat, exposure) live in `lookup/`
- Each dataset is modular, documented, and reproducible
